# Causal Variable Role Identification

Identifies variable roles (instruments, mediators, confounders) in causal pathways using conditional independence testing and regression analysis.

## Methods
- **Conditional Independence Testing**: Determines causal pathways via regression significance
- **Linear Modeling**: Estimates treatment effects with interaction terms  
- **Path Analysis**: Validates S→X→Y, Z→X→Y, X→M→Y pathways

## Key Features
- ATE/ATT/ATC calculation
- Causal effect transportability
- Automated variable role assignment
- Pathway validation
